# Gasby Skill & Code Taxonomy

## Skill Taxonomy

Skills are classified along two axes:
- **Type** (What kind of skill?)
- **Scope** (How broadly or narrowly is it applied?)

### Skill Types
- **technical**: Skills related to technology, programming, tools, and frameworks.
- **cognitive**: Skills involving thinking, reasoning, abstraction, and problem-solving.
- **behavioral**: Skills related to communication, collaboration, and work style.
- **contextual**: Skills involving domain knowledge, industry rules, or situational awareness.

### Skill Scopes
- **general**: Broadly applicable skills across many domains or technologies.
- **specialized**: Skills specific to a particular technology, domain, or context.

## Code Classification Taxonomy

Code is classified along two axes:
- **Code Type** (What kind of code is it?)
- **System Layer** (Where in the stack does it live?)

### Code Types
- **business_logic**: Core business rules, domain logic, and application-specific workflows.
- **application_glue**: Code that orchestrates, routes, or connects components and services.
- **abstractions_frameworks**: Design systems, middleware, shared libraries, and reusable abstractions.
- **integration**: Code for connecting with external systems, APIs, or services.
- **infrastructure**: Infrastructure-as-code, configuration, deployment, and environment setup.
- **testing_observability**: Tests, monitoring, metrics, and observability tooling.
- **documentation**: Documentation, guides, and onboarding materials.
- **scaffolding_setup**: Boilerplate, code generation, and project setup scripts.
- **security**: Security-related code, authentication, authorization, and vulnerability mitigation.

### System Layers
- **frontend**: User interface and client-side code.
- **backend**: Server-side logic, APIs, and business services.
- **infra**: Infrastructure, networking, and environment configuration.
- **data**: Data processing, storage, analytics, and pipelines.
- **devops**: CI/CD, deployment, monitoring, and operational tooling.
- **shared**: Cross-cutting libraries, utilities, and shared modules.

## Extensibility

- All vocabularies are open for extension. You may add new types or layers as your use case evolves.
- For more details, see the vocab files in `/vocab/`. The canonical base URL for schemas and contexts is `https://schema.gasby.co`.
